# Arduino_Projects
This repository contains a collection of 8 Arduino projects designed to help you learn and explore various sensors, displays, and real-world applications. Each project includes code, wiring diagrams, and explanations to guide you in building, understanding, and modifying the projects.

## Projects Overview
Distance Measurement Display
Measure the distance to an object using an ultrasonic sensor, and display the reading on a 7-segment display.

### Smart Distance Counter
Track object crossings within a specified range and display a counter on a 7-segment display. Reset the counter with a touch sensor.

### Touch-Activated Range Finder
Display the distance reading only when a touch sensor is activated, holding the value for 5 seconds on a 7-segment display before clearing.

### Countdown Timer with Obstacle-Activated Reset
Start a countdown on the 7-segment display using a touch sensor. Reset the countdown if an object is detected within range; show "E" if the countdown completes without interruptions.

### Digital Stopwatch
Implement a stopwatch using an LCD display and two buttons: one for start/stop and another for reset.

### Motion-Activated Alarm
Detect motion using a PIR sensor and trigger a buzzer alarm. Log each motion detection timestamp in the Serial Monitor.

### Temperature Monitoring System
Use a DHT11 or LM35 sensor to monitor temperature, displaying data in the Serial Monitor. Include a warning if the temperature exceeds a preset threshold.

### People Counter with Direction Detection
Use two IR sensors and an ultrasonic sensor to count people entering and exiting a doorway, displaying the count on a 7-segment display and determining direction.
